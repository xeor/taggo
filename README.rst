taggo

Tag organizer that uses names of files and folders to create symlinks.
Tags are defined by using #hashtags in the name. They can also be as many sub levels as you want, like #sub-hash-tag

Introduction
------------

This project is in beta stage, please report bugs :)

Resources
---------

* Project hosting `GitHub <https://github.com/xeor/taggo>`_.
* Bug reports are handled on the `issue tracker
  <https://github.com/xeor/taggo/issues>`_.

Any questions, thoughts, bugs are very welcome!


Requirements
------------

* Python 2.6 or newer (not 3.x)

Installation
------------

The only file you will need is the one called taggo. It creates a file
called taggo.cfg if it doesnt exists in the same directory.

What it does
------------

Taggo creates symlinks based on hashtags it finds in the file or foldername.

Here are some examples

.. list-table:: Filename examples

   * - Fil/folder names
     - Creates
   * - A random name.jpg
     - 
   * - dcim1234 #People-Lars #food.jpg
     - 1 link in a folder People/Lars/... and one in food/
   * - 2012-09-25 Oslo tour #Earth-Europe-Norway-Oslo/dcim123...
     - Link to the folder under Earth/Europe/Norway/Oslo/2012-09-25....
   * - dcim123,#tag1.jpg
     - Link to the file under tag1/
   * - dcim321#tag2.jpg
     - Nothing, a tag needs a space, . or , in front and back of the tag.

FAQ
---

* Why the name taggo?

  * I just wanted a name for this for now.. Got any better names,
    please share

* Why do you want to create tags with symlinks?

  * Because everyone have underestimated the power of tagging data.
  * Photo filenames are just wasted, what does DCIM1234.jpg tell you?
  * You know you miss one folder that contains all your dog pictures.
  * You sould not depend on a 3rd party program/database to manage
    your files/photos.
